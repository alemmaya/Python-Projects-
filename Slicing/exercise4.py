"""-------------Exercise 4---------------------------------
Use String Concatenation to answer the following questions
---------------------------------------------------------"""

# (Example) We can concatenate (add) to strings together using addition ( + ) operator 
greetings = "Hello Everyone, My Name is "
my_name = "Marcus" 

#Run the code to see the output.
print(greetings + my_name)

# 1) write your first name in a variable, and your last name in another variable. Then using concatentation display your full name in one line
First_name = "Alemmaya "
last_name= "Abebe"
print(First_name + last_name)

# 2) Using the variables below, print the city, county, state, and country in one line 
city = 'Arlington, '
county = 'Fairfax, '
state = 'Virginia, '
country = 'United States, '
print(city+ county + state + country)

# 3) What happens if you try to concatenate a string and a number? 
# for example: what would be the output here? 
# print('hello world' + 3)
