1) Prices of Lumber

A 2x4 lumber stud (piece) at lowe's has the following pricing structure:
1-10 studs = $8.75 per stud
11-20 studs = cost of 10 studs + $7.75 for each additional stud
21-30 studs = cost of 20 studs + $6.75 for each additional stud
more than 30 studs = cost of 30 studs + $5.75 for each additional stud

- create a program that asks the user to enter the number of lumber studs they would 
like to purchase and calculate the cost.
- For customers who purchase more than 30 studs, ask if they have a builder's license.
If they do, offer a 5% discount off the total.
- display the total cost.
