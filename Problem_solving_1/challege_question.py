''' The following snippets of code have errors in them. For each snippet of code, write what line the 
    error is on, what the name of the error is (you can find both of these in the error statement),
    and in your own words what the problem with the code is. Finally, re-write the code and fix it.
    
    Keep in mind that python will read left to right, top to bottom, and will stop running the
    moment it encounters an error. Because of this, you will need to fix the errors in each section
    of code before you can move on to the next. If you encounter additional errors in trying to 
    fix the code, record what those errors were as well.
