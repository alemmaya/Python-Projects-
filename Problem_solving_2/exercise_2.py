Help me debug my code 

I wrote a program that calculates the cost of my daily expensive coffee habit. Basically, 
I drink one cup of coffee every morning. Each cup of coffee costs $1.19. I tried to calculate 
the monthly cost but I keep getting errors. 

For each error you fix, write a comment of what you did to fix it.

coffee = 1.19 
monthly total = coffee * 30
